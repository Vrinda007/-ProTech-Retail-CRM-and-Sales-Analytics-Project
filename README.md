Welcome to the official repository for my Business Intelligence and CRM project: **"ProTech Retail: BI-driven CRM and Sales Strategy Implementation using Python, HubSpot, and Tableau"**.

This project was built to demonstrate a full-cycle implementation of a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system integrated with **Business Intelligence (BI)** techniques for a retail company â€” from **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, **CRM automation**, to **dashboard development and deployment**.

The project addresses real-world retail challenges such as fragmented databases, inefficient customer management, manual marketing efforts, and lack of actionable insights. Through this project, I showcase my technical and analytical capabilities in solving business problems using modern data and CRM tools, ultimately aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue growth.

## Project Goals
- Implement a **centralized CRM solution** (HubSpot CRM) to efficiently manage customer data and interactions.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract actionable insights from raw retail data.
- Design, build, and deploy **interactive BI dashboards** using Tableau for real-time decision support.
- Automate **marketing segmentation**, **lead scoring**, and **customer engagement workflows**.
- Support **data-driven decision-making** to improve customer retention, streamline operations, and enhance sales performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and EDA.
- **HubSpot CRM** for centralized customer relationship management and automation.
- **Tableau** for developing dynamic and interactive business dashboards.
- **SQL concepts** (Database design, ERD modeling) for backend data structuring and efficient storage.

- Handled missing values, normalized categories, removed duplicates.
- Engineered new features like `Total Transaction Amount`, `Order Month`, and `Order Year`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Identified seasonal and monthly sales peaks.
- **Sales Distribution Analysis**: Uncovered customer spending patterns.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Distinguished high-value, regular, and low-frequency buyers.
- **Regional and Demographic Analysis**: Revealed top-performing regions and customer groups.

### 3. CRM Strategy Implementation (HubSpot CRM)
- **Dynamic Lists**: Auto-segmented customers based on purchase frequency and demographic attributes.
- **Email Automation**: Set up personalized, targeted email workflows for customer engagement.
- **Lead Scoring**: Prioritized high-value customers and warranty purchasers for follow-up.
- **Campaign Performance Tracking**: Monitored customer interactions and campaign success rates.

### 4. BI Dashboard Development (Tableau)
- **Sales Performance Dashboard**: Monitored revenue, regional trends, and top-selling products.
- **Customer Product Insights Dashboard**: Analyzed customer behavior across product categories.
- **Marketing & Sales Dashboard**: Tracked engagement metrics, customer acquisition rates, and campaign effectiveness.

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to bridge **business strategy** with **technical execution**. I have shown complete ownership of the project lifecycle: from handling raw data and drawing deep business insights to implementing CRM automation and delivering actionable dashboards.

It showcases:
- Advanced expertise in **Python data analytics**, **CRM systems**, and **BI tools**.
- Business-driven thinking, focusing not just on technical deliverables but also on real organizational impact.
- Strong ability to manage real-world retail datasets and improve customer relationship practices through technology.
